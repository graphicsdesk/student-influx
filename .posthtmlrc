As the likelihood of a COVID-19 vaccine becomes increasingly imminent, both landlords and housing lenders are eager to take advantage of a restored market. JPMorgan has limited the terms so-called “jumbo loans”- those over $765,000 - that make up 95 percent of the Manhattan real estate market. Landlords are similarly searching for wealthier tenants."
