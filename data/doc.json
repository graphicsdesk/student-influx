After a series of eviction moratorium extensions, Governor Cuomo announced in late September that tenants would be protected until the beginning of 2021. The measures accompany battles across the country to instate more robust rent freezes."

Manhattan alone has fallen below $3000—- marking the first time that three boroughs have seen year-over-year rent declines. As the likelihood of a COVID-19 vaccine becomes increasingly imminent, both landlords and housing lenders are eager to take advantage of a restored market, including students returning to colleges across the city."

In addition, landlords may continue to keep prices high despite demand dropping back to its usual rate after students move back onto campus, he said."

      "value": "The issue: the number of students seeking off-campus will not likely stay at its current rate in future years once the University reinstates housing contracts. In other words, the demand for housing now may not sustain itself in the long-term, but rent prices could remain at the rate set in the short term."

      "type": "text",
      "value": "According to Chapple, it is difficult to predict what the long-term ramifications of an influx of off-campus housing seeking students will mean for the city. The future will largely depend on which neighborhoods will experience concentration of students.  Upper Manhattan, like much of the Bronx, is experiencing ongoing displacement of residents. Displacement when not coupled with robust investment, however, does not signal impending gentrification, she noted."

    {
      "type": "text",
      "value": "“There’s just an ongoing population churn and there’s just sort of a pattern of landlords displacing tenants as a way of eeking out every cent of rent they can get from a property,” she said. “Whatever low income folks are left in those areas close by campus they might be at risk as higher income people, even students, come into those neighborhoods.”"

      "value": "“ It’s very expensive to provide a dorm bed even in a triple. Just new construction whether you are talking about the Bay Area or New York city is just very expensive,” she said. “The question becomes can we force a paradigm shift where we do more online learning somewhere in those first two years so we don’t have to provide all those beds.”"

      "value": "Columbia students returning to live off-campus pose as unequal competitors in the housing market, and this semester has made the divide in wealth and opportunity present in the university population even more apparent to some students. For 20 percent of Upper West Side residents, the median rent accounts for more than 50 percent of their household income- an infeasible cost for many students’ families.  As Cannon began his time at Columbia, the shock at wealth disparities between his classmates turned into acceptance."

    {
      "type": "text",
      "value": "“I definitely think there is unequal footing but it would have existed either way. There's some kids who are incredibly wealthy, like kids in my Zoom classes whose parents can afford apartments on the Upper East Side,” Cannon said. “That kind of wealth is going to manifest itself in so many ways other than that opportunity and in the end they’re going to have a leg up no matter what and at some point you just come to accept that.”"
