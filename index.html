A thousand were granted housing on campus, and the remaining 13,000 found residency scattered across the city with thousands around Morningside Heights. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Those living off-campus this semester entered a New York rental market upended by the COVID-19 crisis as dangerously competitive renters, which could contribute to rising rent prices across West Harlem, housing experts said. </p> <div class="graphic"> <div class="g-body"> <div id="legend"> <svg class="legend" width="60" height="60"><line class="baseline" stroke="gray"/><line class="slope" stroke="#000"/><circle r="3"/><text><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">50% increase</tspan> <tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">in population</tspan></text></svg> </div> <p class="map-title">Census tracts around campus saw large population increases between August and October</p> </div> <div id="maps-container"></div> <div class="g-body"> <p class="image-caption-text">These are estimates made using data provided by the location analysis company <a href="https://www.safegraph.com/covid-19-data-consortium">SafeGraph</a>.

Mary Rocco, a professor of urban studies at Barnard, categorizes the University as a type of “anchor institution” that promotes land speculation and bursts of displacement as its presence is “a signal to developers that this area is ripe for investment”. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> At the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis in March, New York placed a temporary ban on evictions across the state, before limiting the rule’s scope to tenants on unemployment or with other COVID-19 related financial difficulties. After a series of eviction moratorium extensions, Governor Cuomo announced in late September that tenants would be protected until the beginning of 2021. The measures accompany battles across the country to instate more robust rent freezes. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> With the New York rental market in complete upheaval, all boroughs have seen record low median rents in comparison to the past decade. Manhattan alone has fallen below $3000—marking the first time that three boroughs have seen year-over-year rent declines. As the likelihood of a COVID-19 vaccine becomes increasingly imminent, both landlords and housing lenders are eager to take advantage of a restored market, including students returning to colleges across the city. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Between March 1 and May 1, Columbia students were among the 5 percent of residents who left the city. While lower-income neighborhoods had moderate decreases in population, the wealthiest areas of New York saw population decreases of 40 percent or more, including Morningside Heights. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> But while New York City has seen an increase in supply in general, the people who are moving are economically able to, said David Mazzuca, an instructor at the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia’s Earth Institute who specializes in housing recovery. <b>As CD 9’s average per capita income is just over half of the total Manhattan average</b>,this would not apply to much of West Harlem or its tenants. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Instead, the increased interest in the area could drive prices up as demand for housing increases among wealthier potential tenants. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Anytime you have a neighborhood that has an increase in residents who didn't live here about 10 years prior, the price of rentals could increase,” Mazzuca said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In an email to Barnard students on Oct. 27, Dean Leslie Grinage announced that juniors and seniors will be able to carry their financial aid off-campus to rent accomodations in the local area. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Landlords are excited to see Columbia students come in,” said Karen Chapple, CC ’89 and Professor of City and Regional Planning at the University of California, Berkeley. “That helps them realize that there is a replacement market there. So, a lot of them may take advantage of the COVID-19 crisis to prematurely evict people and get ready for the next uptick.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> [Related: <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2020/04/28/landlords-are-waiting-to-pounce-covid-19-casts-grim-future-for-renters-confronted-by-wave-of-evictions/">‘Landlords are waiting to pounce’: COVID-19 casts grim future for renters confronted by wave of evictions</a>] </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> David Hanzal, a member of the Community Board 9 housing, land use, and zoning committee, said the influx of students in the neighborhood could create a false perception that the neighborhood has a high demand, which could in turn lead to higher rent prices. In addition, landlords may continue to keep prices high despite demand dropping back to its usual rate after students move back onto campus, he said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Alternatively, another concern could arise if students who lived off campus in the fall decide to stay off campus and continue to take up housing in the community. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Hannah Prensky, BC ‘22, found a studio in Harlem this fall so she could return to work in a Barnard lab. While the move proved useful for her learning experience, the future for her living situation remains uncertain. While she noted campus housing would be cheaper and more social, she is hesitant to return. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I can go days without talking to friends or anything and obviously that's quite different in a dorm,” she said, “However I wouldn't really feel too comfortable with that until I'm vaccinated so who knows if that will even happen by the time I graduate.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Isabelle Wagler, CC ‘23, expressed similar concerns that a return to campus housing would only be a facsimile of the pre-pandemic experience. The comfort of her 97th street apartment compared to her Carmen suite has come at the cost of community. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I miss coming back and seeing my friends when the elevator doors open,” she said. “I totally understand if we won’t be allowed to socialize, but I still think that’s a big part of living on campus.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> One thing holds true: they hope to return when possible. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Community members like Hanzal believe the short-term growth in the number of students seeking off-campus will not likely stay at its current rate in future years once the University reinstates housing contracts. But Hanzal foresees realtors and landlords applying this short-term demand and market price in the long-term. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In other words, the demand for housing now may not sustain itself in future years, but rent prices could remain at the rate set when thousands of Columbia students moved into the neighborhood. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “When you fill these vacancies with students, realtors and landlords think the actual market is fine, but they’ve just put a bandaid over it,” Hanzal said. “It looks like a solid market when it's not, and now that students can rent those, they can keep those rents at a higher rate.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> According to Chapple, it is difficult to predict what the long-term ramifications of an influx of off-campus housing seeking students will mean for the city. The future will largely depend on which neighborhoods will experience concentration of students. Upper Manhattan, like much of the Bronx, is experiencing ongoing displacement of residents. Displacement when not coupled with robust investment, however, does not signal impending gentrification, she noted. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “There’s just an ongoing population churn and there’s just sort of a pattern of landlords displacing tenants as a way of eeking out every cent of rent they can get from a property,” she said. “Whatever low income folks are left in those areas close by campus they might be at risk as higher income people, even students, come into those neighborhoods.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Columbia students returning to live off-campus pose as unequal competitors in the housing market, and this semester has made the divide in wealth and opportunity present in the university population even more apparent to some students. For 20 percent of Upper West Side residents, the median rent accounts for more than 50 percent of their household income- an infeasible cost for many students’ families. As Mason Cannon, CC ‘24, began his time at Columbia, the shock at wealth disparities between his classmates turned into acceptance. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I definitely think there is unequal footing but it would have existed either way. There's some kids who are incredibly wealthy, like kids in my Zoom classes whose parents can afford apartments on the Upper East Side,” Cannon said. “That kind of wealth is going to manifest itself in so many ways other than that opportunity and in the end they’re going to have a leg up no matter what and at some point you just come to accept that.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> This disparity holds true for Cannon, who did not imagine spending his first year at Columbia at home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where residents pride themselves for their laid-back attitudes and identity as the “land of manana”. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Being in New York everything’s faster and everything is focused,” Cannon said. “It’s definitely hard to be in a city that’s really focused on not taking things too seriously when I was hoping to be in a city where everything is rushed and happening right now.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Meanwhile, community members fear the growth in students off campus housing, even in the short term, will further stress the tenuous relationship between Columbia and the community. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “This situation creates competing interests between students and community members, all of which hurts the integrity of the community,” Hanzal said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Deputy News Editor Abby Melbourne can be contacted at </i><a href="mailto:abby.melbourne@columbiaspectator.com"><i>abby.melbourne@columbiaspectator.com</i></a><i>.
